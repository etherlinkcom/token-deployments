# WXTZ

WXTZ is the token created to replicate the functionality of Wrapped Ether (WETH), but specifically for the Tez (XTZ) native token on Etherlink. The goal of WXTZ is to facilitate the use of XTZ in various decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols that require ERC-20-like tokens.

### Wrapping & Unwrapping

The token follows the `WETH9` interface for compatibility:

- **Wrapping XTZ**: The `deposit()` method can be called with XTZ attached to the message to wrap XTZ for WXTZ
- **Unwrapping XTZ**: The `withdraw(wad)` method can be called unwrap `wad` WXTZ for XTZ

**NB**: The classic wrapper `WETH9` version `0.4.x` also support `fallback()` but we decided **to not support** it because from a security standpoint, supporting the `fallback` hook would cause function signatures that do not match the contract's to act as if they are supported and successfully executed.

### Bridging with LayerZero OFT

WXTZ implements the [Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT)](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart) standard from LayerZero. This allows WXTZ to be bridged in a secure and capital efficient way across different chains through direct minting and burning of the supply.

### Gasless Approval with ERC20Permit

The token also implements the [ERC20Permit](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Permit) standard from Openzeppelin. This allows users to approve token transfers via gasless signatures instead of on-chain transactions. 

This feature leverages the [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) standard to facilitate off-chain authorization for token transfers.


## Deployment & setup

The first step is to deploy the contract on all the chains you want to support. To do so, run the LayerZero deployment tool, and use `WXTZ` as the deployment tag:
```
npx hardhat lz:deploy
```

Then, you need to create a link between the contracts by running `setPeer()`. We created a script to make this easier:
```
targetNetworkName=<TARGET_NETWORK> npx hardhat run --network <SOURCE_NETWORK> scripts/setPeer.ts
```

> ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ **NOTE** ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
> 
> Each `setPeer()` registers a one way connection between the contract on chain A and the contract on chain B. To create a link, you'll need to run the script twice by swapping the source and target networks.
>
> For security purposes, there is a 2 day timelock when you call `setPeer()`. Therefore, for each one-way connection, you'll need to run the script twice with a 2 day delay between calls.

### Example: Etherlink Testnet and Sepolia

The first call will initiate the timelock:

```
targetNetworkName=sepolia npx hardhat run --network etherlinkTestnet scripts/setPeer.ts
targetNetworkName=etherlinkTestnet npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/setPeer.ts
```

If you try to bridge tokens, the transaction will fail because of the timelock. After the timelock has expired, we can call again to create the connection.

```
targetNetworkName=sepolia npx hardhat run --network etherlinkTestnet scripts/setPeer.ts
targetNetworkName=etherlinkTestnet npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/setPeer.ts
```

Now the contracts on Etherlink Testnet and Sepolia are connected and tokens can be bridged with the following script:

```
targetNetworkName=<TARGET_NETWORK> npx hardhat run --network <SOURCE_NETWORK> scripts/sendToken.ts
```

**NB:** if you don't have any WXTZ on the source chain, you won't be able to send any. If you use Etherlink Testnet as the source network, the test will automatically mint you 1 WXTZ. This mint is only doable on Etherlink Testnet.

## Audit & Security

The contract was audited by [Omniscia.io](https://omniscia.io/), here is the link: ADD THE LINK

We decided to make WXTZ an OFT to enable easily cross-chain compatibility. However, this does come with additional risks that we identified and reduced to protect users both native to Etherlink and bridged on other EVM chains:

### 1. Etherlink WXTZ

If the OFT bridge gets compromised, all the XTZ in the contract on Etherlink could be stolen by a malicious attacker as follows:

1. Create and deploy a fake WXTZ contract on another EVM chain
2. Mint a maximum amount of WXTZ on the other chain
3. Connect to the contract on Etherlink using `setPeer()`
4. Transfer the WXTZ to Etherlink
5. Withdraw the XTZ locked in the WXTZ contract on Etherlink

**Solution:** We overrode the `_credit` method used by LayerZero to bridge tokens between chains. We added a condition checking that the receiving amount of WXTZ can't exceed the amount of XTZ stored in the contract. The result is that **only the WXTZ supply bridged** using the LayerZero protocol should be at risk, and not the local WXTZ on Etherlink. If an attacker succeeds in hacking the bridge, he will only be able to transfer the difference between the amount of XTZ stored in the contract and the local total supply of WXTZ on Etherlink. So all the users on Etherlink who own their WXTZ locally will still have their WXTZ backed 1:1 by an XTZ in the contract.

### 2. Bridged WXTZ

As explained above, only the bridged WXTZ on other connected chains should be at risk if the bridging system gets hacked. Still, we added a mechanism as a "backup" to protect bridged users as well.

**Solution:** We overrode the `setPeer()` method used to connect or disconnect WXTZ contracts on different chains. By adding a **2 day timelock** to the `setPeer()` method, there is a 2 day delay between initially creating a connection and the connection being excecuted. If a hacker takes ownership of the contracts and starts connecting or disconnecting, bridged users will have **2 days to bridge back** all their funds on Etherlink and withdraw their XTZ.
